I am a graduate student in computer science at Georgia Tech with a keen interest in machine learning and robotics. Presently, I am a member of Dr. Sonia Chernova's Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning Lab, where my work involves the development of ROS packages for the hello-robot Stretch2 robot. Additionally, I am continuing my research project initiated at the Healthcare Robotics Lab, led by Dr. Charlie Kemp. In this ongoing research endeavor, I am dedicated to creating an intelligent assistive robot system that utilizes the Stretch2 robot to assist older adults living with Mild Cognitive Impairment in locating misplaced objects within household environments.

In the past, I've worked as a research technician at a research institute in my hometown (IPICyT). I developed air quality monitoring devices, analyzed data, and built IoT communication networks. In addition, I've been part of Harvard Medical School's Assitant Professor Yu Shrike Zhang research group, where I worked on Digital Light Processing 3D printers, tissue engineering, and biofabrication. You can see a full list of what I am up to on my webpage and [Reasearch Gate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan-Robledo-Lara).  If you have any question or found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a message to my [personal email](mailto:jlara36@gatech.edu).
